      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;A couple of weeks ago I witnessed a stabbing&amp;hellip;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h1 id=&#34;being-a-better-witness&#34;&gt;Being a better witness&lt;/h1&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I didn’t know it was a stabbing at the time.&lt;/strong&gt; I was walking to the gym when I heard some young men shouting. I could see a few of them in someone’s front garden behind a hedge, pushing and shoving. It sounded brutal. A little girl in school uniform ran past me up the road, and there were a few people from the street nearby, looking on — some of them were on the phone. I called the police and reported what I saw. By the time I’d told them everything I could see, everyone involved had fled down the road.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
